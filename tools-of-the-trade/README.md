# Tools of the trade

Experiments in various languages with topics closer to database storage engines and compute engines

## Java

- [Experiments with Lucene](./lucene-exp/README.md)
- [Microbenchmarking Java with JMH](./microbenchexp/README.md)
- [ASM from Java source](./asm-from-java/README.md)
- [RKDB](./rkdb/README.md)

## Notes

1. JMH seems to be very similar to the C++ Google Benchmark

## TODO

- Create some case studies from my HPC work
